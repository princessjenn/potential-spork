# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

I made a portfolio for my future employers to view my deployed applications in a flexible mobile/desktop fitting document. 
This portfolio contains a multitude of CSS styling and HTML properties essential to the webpage's accesibility. The HTML file is linked with images that redirect my future employer to my current deployed pages to view my work.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I created a navigation bar on the top right corner of my portfolio webpage, and when the one of the nav bar links is clicked, the page scrolls to that chosen section of my portfolio.

I created a link onto the images of my deployed applications section, so that when they are clicked, the browser takes you to the application itself to view my work directly.
